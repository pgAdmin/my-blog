_Disclaimer: My job function has never been in the Sales or Marketing domain. This post is about how we wear the hat of a Salesman in our daily life._

I am a 27-year-old single bachelor who has been an Engineering Manager for the past 3 years. My daily activities are divided into three categories:  
1\. Tasks that I need to do — eg: eat my breakfast  
2\. Tasks that I need to delegate — eg: cooking lunch  
3\. Tasks that I cannot do / cannot delegate (now) — eg: buy an apartment

The tasks that come under “I need to delegate” can be done by me, but they are not a good use of my time. Just because I can do them does not imply that I am the best person to do them. In order to ensure that the task gets done and is done in the best possible manner as per my expectation, I have to wear the hat of a Salesman.

The Basics

Who is a Salesman and what is it that they do?
