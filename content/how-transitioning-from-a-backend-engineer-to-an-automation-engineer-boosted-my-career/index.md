I started my career 5 years ago as a Software Developer for a Bangalore-based dev shop. Angular and Ruby On Rails were hot stuff in those days and there were only a few companies with talent in those technologies. So, obviously the company had a lot of projects from off-shore clients who wanted us to build prototypes. These clients would have an idea and we would be their technical consultants who would make a proof-of-concept, which would then be used to pitch Investors for a fund-raise. Post that, these clients would hire their own tech team and carry things forward.

Due to nature of how the business worked, I ended up coding for 6 projects and numerous technologies in a short span of 3 years. I worked on RoR, AngularJS (1.0), APEX (Salesforce), NodeJS and MeteorJS. In terms of technologies, I started off with Web but also dabbled in IoT and Web-based Multimedia editors along the way.

6 months into my career, I figured that I am not cut out for Frontend. I wasn’t very creative and my approaches were always developer-centric, so if I designed a UI, it looked like Mr Weasley’s house from Harry Potter _(For non-Potter fans: Poorly-structured UI but functional)_. So, I switched to Backend completely and that is when I landed on a project to refactor a Salesforce application and optimise it. I never had any experience with APEX or Java _(only attended 1 course in high school)_ for that matter, but I was 22 and ready to do anything to improve my knowledge and develop my skills. So, I took up that challenge and worked tirelessly for the next **8 months**, refactoring and optimising the application. Like most PaaS, the number of things that you can do is limited to the APIs and the compute abilities that the platform provides. Combine that with a lousy project manager — it was hell. We ended up going back and forth so much that at one point I wasn’t sure what I was doing, but it seemed to work and everyone was happy.

My first big break came when I was assigned to the IoT project — it was mostly writing web APIs in NodeJS and communicating with a hardware using MQTT. NodeJS wasn’t exactly new to the market, but had only a few adopters, mostly startups. Developers were building everything — from APIs to Desktop Applications to Real-time applications. This project had 3 separate teams working together — the Cloud application development team (me and my colleagues), the Hardware development team and the Liaison company that did Project management. My biggest takeaway was understanding every process of Product development — designing the Hardware, choosing the tech stack, estimation of project timeline, habit of documentation and over-communication for efficient work across Remote teams _(I literally flew from Bangalore to Chennai, only to find out that the C programmer was expecting me to send JSON with ‘’ around strings instead of “”)_.

With all these new learnings, I was pretty confident that I could manage projects (_yup, plural!_). I landed myself a Meteor project and I co-managed it with the US-based client. He was a great guy who believed in process and productivity tools (_he had been coding for almost 25 years!_). I would say, this project groomed me as a Team Lead as well as developed my instinct for identifying bad or poorly written code. I was soon assigned 4 projects as Project Manager and while 3 clients were good, 1 really bailed out on us. It was that moment when I realised Project Management is not only about the Product or the Team but also about the Client and the Customers.

One of the few things that you learn at a service-based Startup, is the working of multiple businesses. At the end of 2.5 years, I had detailed knowledge on peer-to-peer lending, loan underwriting & property valuations, multimedia streaming & editing, affiliate marketing, real-estate business and chat applications.

It was around this time that I was assigned to work as a Software Developer on a stealth-mode Startup, who needed to set up and start testing their web application. I had used Selenium in my high-school days, but it was mostly limited to building crawlers. I wasn’t sure if I even wanted to do it. The industry doesn’t give much respect to Software Testing and more than 80% folks in that role only do Manual testing. This new client were against manual testing and while I didn’t think Testing was the right career direction for me, I looked at it as an Engineering problem. The industry-leading solution **Selenium** had a reliability of only 75%, so I had to stabilise that. Next, I had to let these tests run on a CI (in our case, CircleCI).

The biggest relief that I had working as an Automation Engineer, was that there are no long working hours, enough time to plan & execute tasks and having complete insight of the product, yet not having to deal with Customer issues. My real customers were the Developers who would come with test requirements for features from time to time.

> So, how did transitioning from a Backend Engineer to an Automation Engineer boost my career ?

Well — 1) I knew how to build products, 2) I knew how to test them, and 3) I knew enough about iterating UX of a product. I was basically equipped with enough knowledge and experience to be a Product Manager. So, I quit my job and joined another Startup as their **Head of Automation and Infrastructure**. Since then, I have built automation tools to boost Sales & Marketing, built data syncers for multiple 3rd party providers and made some security enhancements.

My career took a leap from someone writing APIs for random purposes to someone designing and implementing tools to boost productivity of the entire company, and at the same time helping developers deliver a flawless product!
