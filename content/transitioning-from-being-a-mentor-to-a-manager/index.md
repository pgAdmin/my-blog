The last 6 months have been a very exciting ride for me. Let me give a brief about myself. I lead the Automation and Infra teams at [Rippling](https://mbsy.co/r9cCd), which is a combined workforce of 8 developers. I have been associated with the company for almost 2 years now and whenever I have to take a leave, I need to appoint 2 people to handle everything in my absence.

> I had never been successful in taking a leave where things would NOT go haywire.

A strong email from my boss(es) would always be waiting for me in my Inbox upon my arrival. And my next couple of days would be spent diffusing the situation and trying to understand how to prevent it from repeating. One fine day I realised that, of almost 1.5 years as an Engineering Manager, I had actually spent them being a Mentor and **NOT** a Manager.



Let me elaborate:  
1) I always gave orders to my team on what to do and how to do it. I almost never asked them for their approach or solutions. It affected their personal growth as well.  
2) I was always reluctant to hand-off tasks if I feared that they would not be able to do it properly or quickly. I found myself sitting on a lot of context on work done / tools built solely by me or developed before they joined.  
3) If someone came to me with a task they were stuck on, instead of pointing them in the right direction, I would end up pair-coding and eventually completing it for them.

Lack of sufficient documentation added fuel to the fire.

> A good manager is one who knows how and when to delegate tasks and when not.

Hence, early September 2019, when I planned another long vacation, I decided to do something to fix this situation. Finding a solution to each of the above problems would resolve this.

One of the first things, that I did was increase collective facetime with the team. I would take knowledge transfer sessions and talk about a simple topic related to the product and based on feedback, kept levelling up the complexity of the topics. This increased the intra-team interaction and formed the foundation for them to understand my decision-making process in crisis situations.

Next, I started invading their comfort-zone by assigning complex tasks which helped them utilise the knowledge they had learnt during the sessions. It helped me understand their unique strengths.



This went on for 4 weeks. Then came the start date of my vacation. I was going on a trip to Europe so I could only be available for 2–3 hours per day to troubleshoot issues. Let me start by saying that I was relatively stress free. I had confidence in my team and knew that even if they did not know everything, they knew enough to make the right decision.

> On a trip of 9 days, I only spent 4 hours in total working / syncing with my team.

It has been my most successful trip (_in all aspects!!_). And there wasn’t any email waiting for me :-D ! Obviously, things **DID** go wrong during that period but they didn’t need me to go over them and triaged / fixed on their own. Out of the above 3 problems, I had solved 1.5 of them. But, I still was sitting on a lot of context and also spending time pair-coding with developers.

To solve this, I created a document titled “**Only Punit knows about this**”. If they ever found themselves answering a question with that phrase, the question would go in the document. And every day, I would spend 30 mins answering those questions. Within a week, I found myself with a lot of free time to focus on things I really wanted to work on and the team felt more empowered than ever before!



My ninjas are now ready to face whatever comes their way, while I plan my next trip! :-)
